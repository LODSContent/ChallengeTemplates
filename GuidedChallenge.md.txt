<!---Guided challenge definition

A guided challenge is intended for learners who have basic familiarity with a concept, but who may be lacking experience and knowledge. Each guided challenge contains a series of 3–5 related tasks that focus on real-world skills. Each guided challenge should take an average learner 30 minutes to complete, on average.

Learners are provided with task-based instructions that simulate a real-world experience. Instructions are action-based and include the input required to complete the task. For learners who need some guidance on how to perform a task, detailed hints are provided in the form of step-by-step instructions, videos, and detailed syntax for commands. Learners can choose to use a hint as needed.

> [challenge-name]: Your Challenge Title

<!---
The title is one of the most important elements of a challenge. It tells the learners what they should be able to do when they have completed the challenge. All titles use title case.

A guided challenge title must begin with an action verb. Some titles may contain the name of the product or technology that is featured in the challenge. If possible, avoid using the word and in a title. In most cases, when you see the word and, you have two different challenges.

Examples
Restore Objects in Azure Active Directory
Configure a Forest Trust Relationship
Manage Active Directory Groups
Implement DirectAccess
Monitor Windows Server by Using Windows PowerShell

>[overview]:
>## Understand the scenario
>
>You are a xxx. You need to xxx. First, you will xxx, and then you will xxx. Next, you will xxx, and then you will xxx. Finally, you will xxx, and then you will xxx.
>
>## Understand your environment
>You will be using xxx.

<!---The Understand the scenario section 
The challenge overview appears on the title page, under the challenge title, and contains a description of the challenge scenario and a summary of the challenge environment. Learners must select the overview in order to display the contents, so some learners may not read this information.

Each challenge contains an introductory paragraph that defines the job role, the requirements of the challenge, and the tasks the learner will perform. 

The opening sentence should state a possible job role associated with the tasks in the challenge. This is your opportunity to add some context to the challenge. 

Opening sentence examples
- You are a database administrator.
- You are a network administrator.
- You are a systems administrator.
- You are a Microsoft 365 administrator.

The second sentence should be in the form of a requirements statement that describes the overall goal of the challenge. Use the phrase “You need to…” to begin your requirements statement. The requirements statement should relate to the title.

Do not use phrases like:
- Your boss has tasked you with…
- The CIO wants you to…
- You have been asked to…

Instead, use the phrase "you need to" to introduce the main requirement of the challenge.

Requirements statement examples
- You need to configure storage for files that are used by a web application.
- You need to create a new test virtual machine that is based on an existing managed disk.
- You need to add users to your organization’s Microsoft 365 tenant.

The outcome, often referred to as the abstract, states what a learner will do in the challenge. You write the abstract by using the following style: 
- “First, you will…Next, you will…Finally, you will….”
- “First, you will…, and then you will …. Next, you will…, and then you will…. Finally, you will…, and then you will….

This structure is mandatory and works well for three to six tasks. It is an easy fit for a challenge, since the average challenge contains three to six tasks.

Take a look at your headings and your summary points, and then turn these into sentences. After you have completed your challenge, make sure that you review your overview to ensure that the it still reflects the final tasks in the challenge.

Abstract examples
- First, you will create accounts for users, and then you will assign licenses to the accounts. Next, you will create a security group, and then you will add the users to the group. Finally, you will remove a user’s license.
- First, you will create an S3 bucket, and then you will enable versioning. Next, you will configure the bucket as a website that allows public access. Finally, you will upload the website files.
- First, you will define a hub site by using the SharePoint admin center. Next, you will create a new site collection, and then you will associate it with the new hub. Finally, you will modify the default site permissions.
The following text is an example of an abstract (scenario) that uses the correct format 

Completed understand the scenario examples

You are a Windows Server administrator assigned to manage your organization's Active Directory Domain Services environment. You need to create new Active Directory groups and manage group membership.  First, you will create distribution and security groups, and then you will add members to the groups. Next, you will ensure that all groups can be used to assign permissions to their members. Finally, you will use Group Policy to control membership of the Domain Admins group.

You are a Microsoft&reg; 365 administrator. You need to manage multiple Office 365 users. First, you will create a security group. Next, you will use a comma-separated values (CSV) file to manage multiple users. Finally, you will add multiple users to a security group by using a single action.

--->

<!---The Understand your environment section should contain one or two sentences that describe the technical environment used in the challenge. Keep this simple!

Use the phrase “You will be using …” when writing about the environment.

- In a challenge that uses virtual machines, state the names of the virtual machines and, if needed, the operating systems installed on the virtual machines.
- In a challenge that uses services, state the services that have been created by using a script. Only include services that the learner will need to use to complete the challenge.

Understand your environment samples
You will be using a virtual machine named DC01 that runs Windows&reg; Server 2019.
You will be using a pre-configured Azure resource group named @lab.CloudResourceGroup(RG1).Name.
You will be using a Windows Server 2016 domain controller named DC01.

<!--- Writing task steps in a guided challenge
The first step in any challenge should provide the instructions needed to sign in to the virtual machine or to the online services environment. After the first time you use Type Text or Copy to clipboard - generally the first step in a task - provide a tip on how to use the feature. 
- The sign in instruction style is a standard. The standard language is available to include in your content. Go to https://github.com/LODSContent/ChallengeTemplates/tree/master/Boilerplate.


Examples
- Sign in to @lab.VirtualMachine(YourLabVM).SelectLink as +++@lab.VirtualMachine(YourLabVM).Username+++ using +++@lab.VirtualMachine(YourLabVM).Password+++ as the password.

    >[!TIP] Select the +++Type Text+++ icon to enter the associated text into the virtual machine.

- Sign in to the Azure portal as ++@lab.CloudPortalCredential(LabAdmin).Username++ using ++@lab.CloudPortalCredential(LabAdmin).Password++ as the password.

    >[!TIP] Select the ++Copy to clipboard++ icon to copy the text string to the clipboard.

In a guided challenge, each task will have at least one step that a user must perform in order to complete the task. In each instructional step, you tell the users what to do, provide any required input, and then if needed, finish the step by telling users what they should use to perform the action in the step. You want to tell them what to do, but not how to do it.

If you switch virtual machines, or write an instruction that requires a user name or password, always provide the credentials. Don't make users go hunting for credentials.

Examples
-	Assign a Global admin role to Amy Rusko by using the Microsoft 365 admin center.
-	Configure Lori Penor’s mailbox to send an Out of Office message for both internal and external users.
-	Create a security group named +++Marketing Admins+++ in the **Corp** | **Groups** organizational unit (OU).
-	Add two users named +++Darlene Rudd+++ and +++Sean Chai+++ to the **HR Admins** group.

When you are writing tasks that require a learner to use a specific cmdlet or method, provide the name of the cmdlet or method in the main instructional step, include a link to the documentation for that cmdlet or method if official documentation is available, and then put the complete code syntax in a hint.

Example
-	Assign licenses to the new users by using the [Set-MsolUserLicense](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/msonline/set-msoluserlicense?view=azureadps-1.0) command.

--->

<!---Use text boxes to store values

Use a text box to store a value that users will want to use later in the challenge — for example, an IP address, a URL, or a password. You can then retrieve the value by using an @lab variable. You can use this as copyable text in an instruction, or you can use it in a command.
- Text boxes and labels should be indented by four spaces.
- Press Tab after the label to force the text box onto a new line, without an extra line break.
- Test your text box by resizing the preview pane to ensure that the text box wraps to a new line.

Example

- Record the name of the data loss prevention (DLP) policy you created in the following text box:

    **DLP name**     
    @lab.TextBox(DLPRuleName)

    This is the value that you entered: @lab.Variable(DLPRuleName).

--->

<!---Writing hints in a guided challenge

Use an expandable hint to provide users with the details of how to perform the action in the step. Hints can contain:
- A video that steps users through what they need to do to perform the action in the step.
- A screenshot that shows the correct configuration, and any UI elements the user must select in order to get to the configuration page.
- An instructional step that uses the what / where / why structure.
- The complete code syntax of any code that is required.

Each hint should describe one instructional step. Ideally, a user who knows the product in a challenge should be able to complete a task without any help. However, if a user is stuck on an individual step, you want to provide the user with the details of how to succeed. Users should be able to expand a hint for one step without seeing any other hints for the task. This allows users to challenge themselves to complete a task with little or no help.

If you are asking users to perform an action for which you have already provided a hint—for example, you ask them to configure a user and provide a hint showing how to do this, and then you ask them to configure a second user—you do not need to provide a second hint that is a repeat of the first hint. Users can go back and look at the initial hint.

Always make sure that there is a blank line between the hint heading and your first bullet, and between your last bullet or image and the closing tag of the hint.

Examples
- Assign licenses to the new users by using the [Set-MsolUserLicense](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/msonline/set-msoluserlicense?view=azureadps-1.0) command.

    >[!HINT]<details>
    ><summary>Expand this hint for guidance on assigning a license.</summary>
    >
    >- Run the following command to assign licenses by using Set-MsolUserLicense command:
    >
    >   ```
    >Get-MsolUser -UnlicensedUsersOnly | Set-MsolUserLicense -AddLicenses $sku
    >```
    >
    >   !IMAGE[SampleImage](Placeholder.jpg)
    >
    ></details>
 
- Remove the Office 365 E5 license assigned to **Beth Burke** by using the Microsoft 365 admin center.

    >[!HINT]<details>
    ><summary>Expand this hint for guidance on removing a license.</summary>
    >
    >- In the Microsoft 365 admin center, on the navigation menu, expand **Users**, and then select **Active users**.
    >
    >- Select **Beth Burke**, and then select **Manage product licenses**.
    >
    >   !IMAGE[SampleImage](Placeholder.jpg)
    >
    ></details>

<!--- Formatting in a guided challenge
- Use bold format for:
 - something in the UI that a user must select.
 - something that a user must verify.
 - keys on the keyboard.
- Do not use bold format:
 - for labels.
 - to help identify the location of an item on a page.
- Use Type Text for values that a user must type.
- The formatting in a hint should match the formatting in the main instruction. Some users choose to use a different method of implementing what’s in the instruction that what you show in the hint, but we need to use a consistent formatting pattern across all challenges, and it's important that we make sure that the key items to configure are called out. 

Examples 
- Verify that the Peering status is **Connected**.
- On the Start menu, expand **Windows Administrative Tools**, and then select **Active Directory Sites and Services**.
- In Active Directory Sites and Services, right-click **Sites**, and then select **New Site**.
- In the Microsoft 365 admin center, on the navigation menu, expand **Users**, and then select **Active users**.
- Enter +++NewYork+++.
- Press **Enter**.

<!---Best practices for writing challenge tasks 
- Create a heading that calls out the purpose of the task. 
- If your task heading contains the word *and*, review the objectives. You may be trying to combine two tasks into one.
- If your task contains a single step, and both the step and the heading use almost identical language, either your task is too granular, or your step is too high level.
- Write steps that tell the learner the action to take and the specific requirements to implement, but not how to perform the action.
- Use a hint in an advanced challenge to provide guidance on how to perform the action.
- Use Type Text or Copy to clipboard for any values that a learner must type.

## Check your work
- [] Confirm that you xxx.
- [] Confirm that you xxx.

<!---Writing check your work statements

Each task must contain a check your work section after the task steps. 
- Use one or more bulleted points that have check boxes.
- Each point should begin with the word Confirm.
- Each point should represent a key outcome of the task, but may not map directly to each step in the task.
 - In general, the check your work statements will map to the individual steps. They should never contain information that was not covered in the task.
- Do not put verification instructions in the check your work section. If users should perform a verification step, include this in the task steps.

Examples
- [] Confirm that you created user accounts for Frano Botica and Louisa Wall.
- [] Confirm that you assigned licenses to the new user accounts.
- [] Confirm that you created a security group named Network Admins in the Corp > Groups OU.
