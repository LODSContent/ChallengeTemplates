A cloud slice is a subset of an Azure subscription that has been assigned to a user account that was provisioned for you for the duration of this Challenge Lab. A cloud slice provides temporary access to a subset of resources available in a cloud subscription so that you can learn the concepts in this Challenge Lab without having to configure your own subscription. 

A cloud slice has restrictions on the types of administrative activities that are allowed. Please follow the instructions carefully, especially with regard to names and other configuration details.
