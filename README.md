# Challenge Template Files

This repo contains templates for the different types of lab challenges:

  - Guided
  - Advanced
  - Expert
  - Getting Started

# Usage

Template usage depends on the version of the template.

## Text file

To use this version, display the file in Raw mode, copy all the text, and then paste it into the lab profile instructions.

## Lab manual export
To use the export version of the templates, download the files and import them into a lab profile you have created. 

### IMPORTANT

Please note that, by default, when you import content into a lab profile, this action will ***overwrite*** previously existing content. If you wish to preserve the content in your lab profile, please ensure you select the option to append the imported content.
